## Instructions


In this exercise, you'll work on implementing a small application that shows a list of companies and on click through, a more detailed page of that company. The core deliverable is having something working that fetches data from the included api and displays that to the user. How you accomplish that is up to you. We'd love to see your creativity and what you choose to focus on!<br><br>
We've provided the initial scaffolding and an api server. We leave it as an exercise to get the project running and interface with the api. <br><br> 

Here's a screenshot to guide your implementation. You can find the full design along with CSS details on figma.

Some examples of things you can focus on are:
- Simple, reusable react components 
- Pixel perfect, well composed CSS that matches figma spec
- Make a better more intuitive design than the one we included
- Extend the functionality to allow a user to create and edit new companies
- Implement a graphql connection to the api server along with a full application side data model
- Write a testing command that verifies the functionality of the frontend

When you're done, email a zipped file of your code to frontendtest@captec.io along with any additional instructions on how to use the code.
